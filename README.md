You can leave this running all day and whenever you need to turn a preview link to a preview and accept link just paste it into the progam and it will automatically open it in a new tab and it will return to the Enter URL: prompt and wait for another preview link.

If you put in a link it can't handle it will give an error.

<strong>Windows Users:</strong> Click "Download ZIP" on the right side of the page. Extract the ```Windows Version 1.0``` folder and run ```panda.exe```. You should be able to use Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V to paste the preview link into the program.
